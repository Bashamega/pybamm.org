PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package written in Python. Our mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by providing open-source tools for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration.

Broadly, PyBaMM consists of

1. A framework for writing and solving systems of differential equations
2. A library of battery models and parameters, and
3. Specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results.

Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.

If you like PyBaMM, please consider starring us on GitHub and spreading the word! You can also fork the repository to add your own models. For information about
donations and how you can support, please see the [Donate](/donate/) page.
