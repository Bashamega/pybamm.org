PyBaMM has been a NumFOCUS Sponsored Project since 2022 and has been used by a multitude of researchers through academia and industry collaborations at numerous companies and research institutions, some of which include the University of Oxford, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Warwick, Imperial College London, National Physical Laboratory, Deutsches Zentrum fÃ¼r Luft- und Raumfahrt, and The Faraday Institution.

If you would like to support the project, please consider donating to PyBaMM to bring forth advancements to a multi-dimensional, interdisciplinary area of battery modelling and simulation combined with fast numerical computing.

## Usage of funds
The sponsorship funds will be utilised to support mini-projects revolving around code, infrastructure, and documentation. The funds will also be frequently used to build community spaces, organise sprints/hackathons, and cover other events revolving around PyBaMM and batteries. Additionally, comparatively large donations will allow us to offer bursaries for people coming from low-income countries/institutions or even sponsor a PhD candidate!
