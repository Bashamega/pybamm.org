## Example notebooks

If you would like to get started with PyBaMM, you may go through the [Getting Started notebooks](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop/examples/) which introduce its basic features. You can launch the notebooks on Google Colab to run them on the cloud without having to install PyBaMM on your computer.
