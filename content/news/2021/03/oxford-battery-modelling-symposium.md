summary: Virtual poster presentation for PyBaMM
---

Today the PyBaMM team presented a poster at the Oxford Battery Modelling Symposium 2021. The third edition of the OBMS ran virtually with Prof. Yue Qi (Brown University), Prof. Daniel Steingart (Columbia University) and Dr. Birger Horstmann (Helmholtz Institute Ulm) as keynote speakers.

The poster can be found in the [pybamm supporting material](https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-supporting-material/blob/master/2021-03-OBMS-poster/OBMS21_pybamm.pdf) and it outlines the main features of PyBaMM along with some case studies, including thermal models (pouch and cylindrical cells) and degradation models (SEI, plating and cracking). The poster contains many links to the relevant code and papers.

You may try out PyBaMM for yourself by going to [Examples](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop/examples/) (to see the examples) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/blob/develop) (to run them online).
