Valentin Sulzer (University of Michigan) presented PyBaMM today at the weekly
Battery Modeling Webinar Series, an event which attracts audience from across
the world with a wide range of interests.

The talk outlined PyBaMM's mission as an open-source framework for
collaborative battery modeling, and gave an overview of the fast, flexible, and
reliable modeling structure. A series of case studies showcasing a wide range
of applications of PyBaMM was presented, concluding with a live demonstration
of the software.

Thank you to everyone who joined, and to the many who asked insightful
questions - and especially to Venkat Subramanian for a great impromptu
discussion at the end on benchmark times for solving the DFN. Thanks also to
David Howey, Shashank Sripad, and Venkat Viswanathan for hosting and moderating.

As usual, you can find slides for the talk ([PDF](https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-supporting-material/blob/master/2020-09-BMWS-slides/2020-09-BMWS-PyBaMM.pdf) or [PPTX](https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-supporting-material/blob/master/2020-09-BMWS-slides/2020-09-BMWS-PyBaMM.pptx))
and try out PyBaMM for yourself by going to [Examples](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop/examples/) (to see the
