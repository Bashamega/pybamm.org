Robert Timms (University of Oxford) presented PyBaMM today in the Faraday Institution Annual Conference that took place online.

The talk introduced the main features of PyBaMM's framework and then presented different real case studies. These case studies showcased how PyBaMM can be used to simulate mechanical, thermal and degradation effects.

The recording of the talk is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YlFr930Cv8&ab_channel=PyBaMM). try out PyBaMM for yourself by going to [Examples](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop/examples/) (to see the examples) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/blob/develop) (to run them online, with no local installation).
